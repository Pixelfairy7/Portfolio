# portfolio

Yet another iteration of my portfolio which can be found at [https://pixelfairy7.github.io/portfolio/]

## The project:

It's safe to say that most people recommend new devs create a portfolio, so here we are. The goal of this project was to convey my personality and skills as clearly and quickly to the user but also with a few goals in mind. 
I wanted to make sure my portfolio met the following and anything else was a bonus 
-Accessible
-Modern
-An accurate reflection of my skill level currently and also showing growth over time 

### Accessible :wheelchair:
Its important for my portfolio to be accessible because a11y is for everyone. As a developer a11y is one of my focuses and what better way to show employers I can add value to their organization by making sure their product is accessible than starting with myself? The concepts I focused on were
-Semantic HTML and proper ARIA labeling 
-An accessible color palette that at least had an WCAG score of AA and AAA if possible 

### Modern :sparkles: 
I wanted to do everything by hand instead of using something like Bootstrap/MaterializeCSS. While I enjoy working with them at times I felt it would be easier to be more accessible and since the project is not heavy on JS why not?
I also decided to use SCSS and my plan is to also refactor it using a CSS arctitecture method such as SMACSSmor BEM.
